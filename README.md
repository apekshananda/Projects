# Project List:

- K-Mean Clustering

I adeptly implemented the K-means clustering algorithm, a potent tool for unsupervised learning. This algorithm, recognized for its efficiency, was applied to group data points into distinct clusters, unraveling concealed patterns within the datasets. 

- Classification and Regression Trees

In our loan approval prediction project, we employed the CART algorithm to build a decision tree using features such as Debt to Income Ratio, FICO score, and Request Amount. Guided by the Gini index, we systematically reduced features at each node, optimizing splits for enhanced model simplicity. This approach facilitated the creation of a streamlined decision tree that not only predicted loan approval but also provided a clear understanding of the most influential features in the decision-making process.

- CheapFare Airline Reservation Relational Database

Our group was tasked with designing and implementing a relational database for CheapFare, an airline reservation company specializing in domestic and international flight bookings. The goal was to create a robust database system to manage bookings, flights, e-tickets, travelers, and other relevant entities efficiently.Designing and implementing a relational database for CheapFare, an airline reservation company specializing in domestic and international flight bookings.

- Web Design and Rental Application Development

The server-side application developed using Node, Express, and Handlebars enables seamless item rentals by providing a user-friendly interface and efficient functionality. Through intuitive Handlebars templates for home and error pages, the application enhances user experience and accessibility, ensuring a smooth browsing and interaction process. With a robust data model for rental items, including unique IDs and properties, data management processes are streamlined, facilitating effective organization and retrieval of information. Additionally, various functionalities such as search, rental, return, and result updates are seamlessly integrated through dedicated server endpoints, ensuring smooth and efficient operation of the application.

-Analog Circuit Simulator

This project aims to develop Analog Circuit Simulator (ANASIM), capable of simulating analog electronic circuits using numerical methods, machine learning, and heuristic algorithms. ANASIM is designed to address the challenge of simulating nonlinear behavior in circuits through various approaches. Theoretical background encompasses numerical methods like Euler's and Runge-Kutta methods, machine learning cost functions for approximating real data, and heuristic algorithms for faster problem-solving. Work breakdown includes implementing a cost function for predicting component currents, integrating circuit components such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors, and utilizing OpenGL for visualization. A sample run involves applying sinusoidal voltage and plotting results to display applied voltage and component voltages over time.
